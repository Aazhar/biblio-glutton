      "description": "We test cosmological models of structure formation using the rotation curve\nof the nearest spiral galaxy, M31, determined using a recent deep, full-disk\n21-cm imaging survey smoothed to 466 pc resolution. We fit a tilted ring model\nto the HI data from 8 to 37 kpc. The disk of M31 warps from 25 kpc outwards and\nbecomes more inclined with respect to our line of sight. Newtonian dynamics\nwithout a dark matter halo provide a very poor fit to the rotation curve\nderived using the warp model. In the framework of modified Newtonian dynamic\nhowever the 21-cm rotation curve is well fitted by the gravitational potential\ntraced by the baryonic matter density alone. The inclusion of a dark matter\nhalo with a density profile as predicted by structure formation in a\nhierarchical clustering LambdaCDM cosmology makes the mass model in newtonian\ndynamic compatible with the rotation curve data. The dark halo concentration\nfor the best fit is C=12 and its total mass is 1.2 10^{12} Msun. If a dark halo\nmodel with a constant density core is considered, the core radius has to be\nlarger than 20 kpc in order for the model to fit to the data. We extrapolate\nthe best-fit LambdaCDM and constant-density core mass models to very large\ngalactocentric radii, comparable to the size of the dark matter halo. A\ncomparison of the predicted mass with the M31 mass determined at such large\nradii using other dynamical tracers, confirms the validity of our results. In\nparticular the LambdaCDM dark halo model which best fits the 21-cm data well\nreproduces the M31 mass traced out to 560 kpc. Our estimated total mass of M31\nis 1.3 10^{12} Msun, with 12% baryonic fraction and only 6% of the baryons in\nneutral gas.Comment: 19 pages, 16 figures, accepted for publication in A&",

M.</dc:creator><dc:creator>\n Braun, Robert</dc:creator><dc:creator>\n Thilker, David A.</dc:creator><dc:subject>\n Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics</dc:subject><dc:description>\n   We test cosmological models of structure formation using the rotation curve\nof the nearest spiral galaxy, M31, determined using a recent deep, full-disk\n21-cm imaging survey smoothed to 466 pc resolution. We fit a tilted ring model\nto the HI data from 8 to 37 kpc. The disk of M31 warps from 25 kpc outwards and\nbecomes more inclined with respect to our line of sight. Newtonian dynamics\nwithout a dark matter halo provide a very poor fit to the rotation curve\nderived using the warp model. In the framework of modified Newtonian dynamic\nhowever the 21-cm rotation curve is well fitted by the gravitational potential\ntraced by the baryonic matter density alone. The inclusion of a dark matter\nhalo with a density profile as predicted by structure formation in a\nhierarchical clustering LambdaCDM cosmology makes the mass model in newtonian\ndynamic compatible with the rotation curve data. The dark halo concentration\nfor the best fit is C=12 and its total mass is 1.2 10^{12} Msun. If a dark halo\nmodel with a constant density core is considered, the core radius has to be\nlarger than 20 kpc in order for the model to fit to the data. We extrapolate\nthe best-fit LambdaCDM and constant-density core mass models to very large\ngalactocentric radii, comparable to the size of the dark matter halo. A\ncomparison of the predicted mass with the M31 mass determined at such large\nradii using other dynamical tracers, confirms the validity of our results. In\nparticular the LambdaCDM dark halo model which best fits the 21-cm data well\nreproduces the M31 mass traced out to 560 kpc. Our estimated total mass of M31\nis 1.3 10^{12} Msun, with 12% baryonic fraction and only 6% of the baryons in\nneutral gas.\n</dc:description><dc:description>\n Comment: 19 pages, 16 figures, accepted for publication in A&A</dc:description><dc:date>\n 2009-12-21</dc:date><dc:type>\n text</dc:type><dc:identifier>\n http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.4133</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\n doi:10.1051/0004-6361/200913297</dc:identifier>\n </oai_dc:dc>\n</metadata>\n</record>"
